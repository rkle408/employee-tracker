# employee-tracker

Running a company is a great and daunting task. It is vital to success to be able to stay organized, streamlined, and clear-cut. Utilizing this application, it will be easy to view, add, and update company departments, roles, and employees. This system will help your company grow without the stress of worrying if everything and everyone is accounted for, and it is easy to use, so as leaders become more hands-off in day-to-day operations, this task can be delegated to others.

In building this project, I learned the importance of combining existing knowledge or pieces of information in order to create something complex and incredibly useful. I learned that there are many ways to execute one's logic, and that it is important to get a function to work, then refactor later. I learned that it is okay to spend time writing code, then deciding to delete it because you found a better way to do it.
